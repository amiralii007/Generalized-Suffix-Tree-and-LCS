# Generalized Suffix Tree and Longest Common Subsequence
This project created for finding The longest Common Subsequence with creating  Generalized Suffix Tree in java
the both order of creating tree and LCS is O(n)
 * this tree creation is based on http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf and we using the ukkonen's algorithm
 * to create "On-line construction of suffix trees" so generally we just create the correct shape of java of this code
 * based on https://doc.lagout.org/Others/Data%20Structures/Advanced%20Data%20Structures%20%5BBrass%202008-09-08%5D.pdf ("Advanced data structure") book
 *  the main source is created in c and it was uncompleted.
